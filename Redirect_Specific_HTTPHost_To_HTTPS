#By doing it this way we can use whats called an "iRule Data Group List" to contain all the domains we want to redirect.
#Each time we want to add a domain we don't need to touch the iRule itself, only add the domain to the data group list.
# For example create "FundRedirectToHTTPS"

when HTTP_REQUEST {
 if { ([class match [string tolower [HTTP::host]] equals "FundRedirectToHTTPS"] ) } {
  HTTP::redirect "https://[HTTP::host][HTTP::uri]"
  }
 }
